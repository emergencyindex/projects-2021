Performance-Drawings such as "Waali Land‚Äù was created by incorporating performance, writing, and gesture drawing to create immersive environments engaging experiences relating race and gender identity with black hxstories and cultural traditions in Amerxxxica.

Yessssssss!, we must acknowledge dat de work we do or have done was created on stolen land. Dis piece in particular was created on Waali Land! We must also acknowledge dat dis work was dreated by a descendent of de stolen Africans, de enslaved Africans, de freed Africans, de negros, de Blacks, de Afro-Americans, de African Americans, de Black Americans, de folks African and African American diasporas, and zir future decedents! Rendered of tracing paper one figure is drawn multiple times, or multiple figures of different genders are moving, jumping, thrusting, dancing, giggling, moaning, struggling, leaping, gyrating, snaping, levitating, floating, skipping, bending, strolling, running, jerking, spinning, playing etc. all while black. De movements of dees figure(s) coupled wit de variety of black and gray marks both in de foreground, middle ground, and background give de image som depth but a since of circular fluid motion also. An opaqueness occurs at de bottom of de image from de left and moves the viewer up most of de bottom and top fight of de image. De lines are whole and broken in various areas, and negative spaces make up shapes and parts of de human body. None of dees marks go off de edge of de page. De image appears to have been drawn fast but the marks are not sloppy de have a tight almost whimsical feel tah them. Like de renderer was slowly unwinding a spool of thread made up of human figures.
