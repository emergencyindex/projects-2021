"Soapbox Construction: 101" was filmed for the Lots of Love performance festival in the Mile End neighborhood of Montreal in the summer of 2021. The performance involved the artists working in a garage and rummaging the alley to find materials to build a soapbox to eventually race. It was such a failure and success. We as a collaborators took the principle of constructing as queer artists in a father-son activity. We both challenge gender constructs with humor and work with past experiences, memories, and trauma. The performance was six hours long. It was documented on video by Caroline St-Laurent and edited by Richard Mugwaneza who also did the photography.
