On Sunday, August 29th from 1pm-7pm, *REPOSE* travelled the 1.4 mile shoreline between Beach 86th Street and Beach 110th Street. *REPOSE* borrowed from the social and physical choreographies inherent to the beach—from the sun-bathing bodies lying in repose, to the posturing of the self in forms of commercialized leisure sanctioned by the Parks Department that police and maintain the shoreline. By mirroring these actions, *REPOSE* both imposed on, and blended into, the beach’s elemental composition, landscape, and communities. As the work travelled with an evolving cohort of 21 dancers, the public was invited, wittingly and unwittingly, to participate. Various instructions and scores for participation were released online and in print prior to and available on the day of the performance. At 6pm at Beach 110th Street, experimental musician/composer David Watson created a new composition activating the beach through sound including live performance and processed field recordings. The beach-as-stage that *REPOSE* made use of throughout the day concluded with a sonic sunset.
