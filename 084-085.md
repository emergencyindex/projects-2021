"Soapbox Construction: 101" was filmed for Lots of Love performance festival in Mile End neighbourhood of Montreal in summer 2021. The performance was us working in a garage and rummaging the alley to find materials to build a soapbox to eventually race. It was such a failure and success. We as a collaborators took the principal of constructing as queer artists in a father-son activity. We both challenge gender constructs with humour and work with past experiences, memories and trauma.The performance is six hours long. It was documented on video by Caroline St-Laurent and edited by Richard Mugwaneza who also did the photography.
