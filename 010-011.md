Island, Is Land, We Land was an artist lead communal performance for the tiny island site, an active digging into our embodied connection with the whenua (land) and the poetic construct of being an island together. The performance sought to deepen our relationship with the Earth we inhabit in the critical context of Climate Emergency; a shared act of bare, ritual stillness. The concept also reflects narratives of isolation and togetherness. I gathered participants, we removed our clothing to swim naked over to the small island. Two buckets of Papa rock that I collected from Kai Iwi and carried to the site was waiting for us. Taking our time throughout the morning, slowly and purposefully covering each other in the soft Papa rock; we performed gentle movements with our bodies, breath and voice. The poem I have written below reflects the concepts and the experience of my performance: 

Sunday after Friday
It is the Papa rock, the Papa of Papatūānuku
Wet from the tide of Kai Iwi
Dried, dusted and lost in the crevices of collected bodies,
Embedding under nails
Staining lines between moons
A peppered residue in outer ear canals
Opaque blue-grey bead deliquesce
Seeping away from the parched corners of clotted tear ducts
A cool, firm, clay touch
Yielding warm flesh beneath fingers pressed
Hineahuone, the first mother
A damp Earth vagina
Plum lips kissing the whenua
Melding the island together, a resounding chorus of rising breath
Embodying an ethereal call to the Patupairehe
Baked and flaking as morning sun shadows slip away
Fresh smears over pale skin and copper beards
Dust! The smoothest, finest, purest 15 million years in formation ancient
Ghost of unconsolidated soil uplifted, crumbling
Over caking nipples exposing pinker pinkness within
Darker when moist blue-grey colour of our endangered kōkako
Papa rock clay
Haunting songs of extinction. Can anything be saved?
Bare feet on an island, in the Mangamahu Stream, on an island
On an island
Which spells fill your boots? Left on entering my tent
Legs stretch out the open fly
Flapping zippers unzipped
Under a starry, electric avalanche, Milky Way sky
A place where tongues meet
The tongues of the present, the tongues of our consciousness
And maybe the tongues of future harmony
Saving us from something
Somewhere in nowhere, over the Mangamahu Bridge
Beyond time
For a hushed, sustained and gentle nap
Tuesday after Sunday
