" Think for yourself. Question authority. Throughout human history, as our species has faced the frightening, terrorizing fact that we do not know who we are, or where we are going in this ocean of chaos. It has been the authorities, the political, the religious, the educational authorities who attempted to comfort us by giving us order, rules, regulations, informing, forming in our minds their view of reality. To think for yourself you must question authority and learn how to put yourself in a state of vulnerable, open- mindedness; chaotic, confused, vulnerability to inform yourself. Think for yourself. Question authority. "  (Leary, 1996) 

This past years have been ones of doubt and confusion: a global pandemic has brought attention to a socio-political state of affairs rich of uncertainties, concerns and consternations. Psychological distress following major social disasters have led people to lose a wide range of benefits crucial to individuals such as growth, satisfaction and a sense of identity. American psychologist Susan Jeffers argues that the contemporary attitude of people to “grasp for control” results as them become unbearably uncomfortable about uncertainty, which is dealt with by consuming anxiety medications or going into denial. She claims that an acceptance of uncertainty is empowering and that giving into distress leads instead to anxiety.

Philosopher Hannah Arendt, soon after WW2, wrote something that sounds now as contemporary as ever: “In an ever-changing, incomprehensible world the masses had reached the point where they would, at the same time, believe everything and nothing, think that everything was possible and nothing was true” (1973, p.382). Political leaders could make people believe anything and its opposite and admire them for their strategic intelligence.

Between a Kick and a Cuddle hereby responds by using, and embracing confusion, using doubt and uncertainty, approaching them as generative means of creation, and asking: “What happens, if doubt is a place of potential?”. Doubting becomes important as it challenges the status quo of things. It helps us to think critically. It also confronts us with our fears, in the face of multiple options. Uncomfortable and risky to inhabit, uncertainty is to be lived through, void of guarantees. In this performance work, it is to be practiced through doubt, to run from definition, between a desire to escape and one to evaluate possibilities. The body becomes torn between states, between going or staying, torn Between a Kick and a Cuddle.
