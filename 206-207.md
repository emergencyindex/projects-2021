Made in Power is a performative installation (2x2x6 ft.) aims to exploit the social injustice that’s inflicted upon every one of us. It incorporates the metaphorical voice of machinery apparatus to reveal the contrived structural trap of which it intertwined as a delusional freewill and defaulting on unalienable human rights while involuntary “mute” became an acquiescent contract. It enables the visualization of the individuals’ vulnerability in the circumstance of confronting the injustice core of the entire social structure. The work invites viewers to reflect on our own situation; we become the object of power rather than a subject of communication. 

Made in Power consists of a Matrix dot-printer with a modern digital shredder which is placed inside of the 24x24”x72” transparent box constructed in 6 pieces of plexiglass, a stack of paper in a roll, 100 inches of “crime scene do not cross” Barricade tape. The “crime scene do not cross” Barricade tape” wrapping around this enlarged transparent “packaging box” which has the matrix printer mounting on the top piece of the box with the shredder placing on the bottom piece of it. The front side of the box has the vinyl letters feature a line of the title of the installation: “Made in Power”. Both machinery apparatus operates at the same time while the output part of the printer with the “pass entry” part of the shredder is connected by the paper when the machines are operating to ensure the printed papers directly fall into the shredder. The printer continually repeats the one and the only printing job of printing the” Universal Declaration of Human Rights”. The nature of this proposed public installation is to keep viewers to be engaged visually as a its nature of forming a dialogue that directly responds to the present occurrences with no physical interaction is needed.
