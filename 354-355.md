“Made in Power” is a performative installation that explores the social injustice that’s inflicted upon every one of us. It incorporates the metaphorical voice of machinery to reveal the contrived structural trap, in which freewill is a delusion that ensures defaulting on human rights while instilling an involuntary “muteness” and sealing an unwilling contract. It enables the visualization of the individuals’ vulnerability in the circumstance of confronting the injustice core of the entire social structure. The work invites viewers to reflect on our own situation; we become the object of power rather than a subject of communication.

“Made in Power” consists of a Matrix dot-printer with a modern digital shredder which is placed inside of a transparent box, constructed with six pieces of plexiglass, a stack of paper in a roll, and 100 inches of “crime scene do not cross” barricade tape.  The front side of the box has vinyl letters featuring a the title text: “Made in Power.” Both machines operate at the same time. The output part of the printer with the “pass entry” part of the shredder is connected by the paper when the machines are operating to ensure the printed papers directly feed into the shredder. The printer continually repeats only one printing job: printing the “Universal Declaration of Human Rights.” The nature of this proposed public installation is to keep viewers engaged visually, forming a dialogue that directly responds to the present circumstances when no physical interaction is needed.
