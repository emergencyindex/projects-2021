“Full of Subtlety, if You Believe Me” was a series of fifteen performative events stemming from my larger work “840 Variations on Vexations,” a project which presents conceptual, poetic responses to duration, endurance, labor, and artistic interpretation, providing possibilities and inspirations for artists and musicians considering their own roles in labor and the re-inscription of the creative process. 

Throughout the recent year we found ourselves going through cycles of restriction, repetition and boredom – noticing more astutely the simple gestures and routines of our daily lives, dictated by the pandemic. Through a selection of works done by single performers - gesture, repetition and labor will be interpreted and perceived through Co-Prosperity’s glass window displays. Like listening to or playing *Vexations* 840 times, these works approach the evolution of boredom: from an offensive characteristic we are encouraged to avoid, to familiarity, acceptance and investment and finally, to a heightened intensity of experience. As silence offsets, complements and drives sound, so boredom offsets, complements and drives excitement. 

Each Saturday a performer in each of the three windows at CoProsperity performed one of my "840 Variations on Vexations" prompts, interpreting them via their own practice and lens.
