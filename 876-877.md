In my performance “Ecologies of Listening, Environmental Entanglements (Short Version)” I investigate the relevance of listening in performance art as well as in everyday life while specifically focusing on the rhythmic and kinaesthetic role of sound-practical actions with things. The questions that guide me are: How do we relate to the things that surround us through their sounding and our listening? What stories do these things’ sounds tell, and how do we move with them in space? What kind of knowledges come into being through sound-practical actions with things? In this short version of the performance, the idea is to perform and compose sonic encounters with the things in space and work from within the very situation and live process. Having placed a variety of things in the space, I start moving from one thing (sound) to another through entering a particular mode of listening to myself, to the things that surround me, to the Earth and to the world. In this mode of *inter-are* (Salomé Voegelin) and *being-with* (Donna J. Haraway) I explore aspects and conditions of human–non-human coexistence and environmental entanglements. Here, listening-with is an ecological practice (perception) but also a method of dealing with the challenges connected to the climate crisis and the transformations of our ecosystems. Wandering between my personally felt mental climates of rage, hope, and sadness, and the memories and stories connected to the thing sounds present in the space, I let myself enter into a sonic flow and engage in sonic encounters through moving-with and listening-with the things. I follow their material responses and let myself guide and inspire by our performative dialogue, paying attention to their specific material qualities, stories, and resistances. In doing so, a sonic *relationscape* (Erin Manning) and *string figure* (Haraway) come into being in a playful, care-taking and sometimes conflicting manner. These entanglements, which make every process in life a form of co-mmunication, co-llaboration, and co-mmunity, are part of us, of how we relate, of our movements and (inter-)actions, of our perceptions and experiences, of our bodies and minds, and of our world(s).
