My man locked in white (construction) foil tries to free himself from the space of the absurd. The pandemic time has changed everything around and out of it all rebellion is emerging, hope for tomorrow is emerging. The performative action shows the world of art, the world in a contemporary art studio, in the middle of Europe. The independence of the place of my studio and my archetypal trance art is a distance to the present world, it is a polemic with the iconosphere of public space, it is a polemic with the populist world that kills humanism. During the performance, my actor in my performance uses kitchen mortar for grinding grain as a liturgical bell, referring to the mystery of a religious rite.It's a seed of life. It uses a breathing tube to trap air, oxygen.The omnipresent religious narrative has destroyed the peace of civic life in Poland in recent years. All these clear signals and coded signs co-created one image of a closed man and at the same time crossing the borders of the cage, absurd and populism.

The intermedia character of the artist's work makes the performance complementary to the visual arts.
