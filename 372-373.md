Rarey gathered the performers to collaborate on a Zoom performance of Shakespeare's “The Tempest.” Our intention was to confront the racism, sexism, and colonialism in the text by collaging it with other texts by other authors and providing historical context for the colonialist project which the play both aided and was aided by in the seventeenth century. Workshops took place over the winter of 2020–2021 on Zoom, and included reading “The Tempest” as well as additional historical texts such as the firsthand account of a shipwreck on which “The Tempest” is based. After the weather started to warm up in spring, it seemed like no one wanted to come to rehearsals on Zoom (or otherwise) any more. Also the more we looked at “The Tempest,” the less we felt compelled to wrestle with it. The problematic nature of the text seemed best addressed by using the text as little as possible. Instead Rarey wrote a one-act comedy called “The Tempest: a Gay Play, or In This Essay I Will” about queer people living in Detroit during the pandemic with certain themes and character names and short textual passages pulled from Shakespeare's play. We performed in Eli Rarey's house after a massive storm that caused flooding across the county. At the end of the play, the characters gather to eat chicken and waffles. Fried chicken and waffles were then served to the audience, followed by a party into the wee hours of the night. Zoom was not implemented in any way as part of the performance.
