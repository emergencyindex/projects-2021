“Tazo ASMR” is a continuation of Faircloth’s ongoing body of work, “Bordertown ASMR.” Faircloth demonstrates role-play situations and food that embodies her bordertown experiences. Faircloth often thinks about the feeling that was so common among youth in her town, which was the desire to be visible in the media without it being perpetuated by stereotypes of border-town life.  In “Tazo ASMR,” Faircloth re-contextualizes found objects by printing portraits of actresses on aluminum discs; making her own tazos. Through this process, the artist makes a connection between herself as an ASMR performer with actresses that have influenced her online presence and femininity. Tazos, also known as pogs, is a children’s game that Faircloth recalls being played at her grade-school courtyard; it was mostly a boys game. Tazos also functioned as collectibles, and much like ASMR, were popular worldwide yet varied in material and popular culture-related imagery depending on where they were being distributed. In the performance, Faircloth and Josselin Salazar play the game while eating Tostitos brand chips at Mitchell Park in Tempe, close to where they both reside. The performance contains audio of metal clanging, chip bag noises, and chip crunches, to create a stimulating experience for the viewer. Faircloth ends up winning the game.
