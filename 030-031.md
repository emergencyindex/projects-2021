Everyone is breathing.
This everything around us - inside us.
How can this invisible community become visible? 
What is the Shape of Breath?
How do we experience this shared and unseen? 

In our artistic research, we have established a recurring method where a dialogue between the glass in its unique liquid form and breathing is captured and presented as sculptures called Expressions of Breath. The physical and visual experience of lifting and laying down, holding and carrying these sculptures in different landscapes is the core of our performances. The questions above act as a starting point for our process-oriented and co-creational body of work Expressions of Breath. When the pandemic changed our ways of living, we still wanted to give the audience a physical art experience involving glass and movements, even if we could not be present. 

“Låne pust (Lend a Breath) / series 1” is a long durational performance work carried out by the audience as co-creators.  By lending a performance kit at the public library, the audience do their solo performances at a self-chosen time and place, with or without an audience. The performance kit consists of a glass sculpture Expression of Breath, a notebook, cleaning cloth and a QR code to audio guides. The audio guides present instructions for performances as an inspiration. In total 24 boxes with unique glass sculptures are available at the seven library branches in the city of Bergen. The co-creators may lend the box for 2 weeks. The lender can leave traces of their experience in the notebook, visible for the next person.
