“Written Portraits” is a participative performance based on improvisation where, as painters do, Adrián Dozetas portrays a person improvising a poem with his typewriter and the person gets the poem in a paper as a present. This performance is based on improvisational live music (Aron Hollinger) and improvisational contemporary dance (Karlotta Frank), disciplines which not only drive the moment and the words into an experience of trance and human interconnection but also tend to portray the person in its own language. Art as an act. The writer beyond his desk. Telling stories that the skin tells. Live. In the moment. Creating with no premeditation. The music there to portray the person, to express its abstraction. And to give a surrounding ambience. And the dance. The movements that describe the portrayed. The vibration of this person. Captured in motion. All this together. As mirroring experience, in the moment. For the moment. Remaining as part of our experience. Imprinted on a paper.The poems can be written in Spanish, English, German or French.
