Responding to the absence of invigilators during the pandemic, and too the public from galleries which now put their shows on view from the street and offered virtual exhibitions online, we devised this performance to address this curious dichotomy. Conscious of our displacement from our workplaces, we were also aware of the shared constraint upon one's experience of art in either real life through a window from the street or a window online.

We therefore chose to create our own space where each view could exist in parallel. Images of these spaces were coupled with perceptual impressions of both and included the presence of a DROSS invigilator. The relay was performed in real-time to an online audience. Sequences of images and texts were posted to social media in staggered posts over three hours. Each sequence was also complemented by an invigilator-themed meme containing a link to the location of the next post. In this way we aimed to question the limits on attention that these constrained experiences engender but also to draw attention to the omission of invigilators from both these spaces.

The process of the performance was as follows: A DROSS documenter recorded images of galleries where the exhibitions could be seen in whole or part from the street. In addition, they also made a brief written record of their experience of the place. Both images and text were then sent to a DROSS netizen at another location.  

Receiving these in staggered messages as further galleries were located and documented, the netizen used this time to locate each gallery's presence online. They then took screenshots of each site and recorded their impressions. Each set of texts and images made were then added to the first corresponding set, and then both sets were forwarded to a DROSS compiler to assemble.  

Collaging both sets of images with that of an invigilator into a new three-dimensional space reminiscent of a video installation, the compiler then juxtaposed this new image with the textual impressions of the two operatives. The resulting image and texts were then posted to social media platforms thereby signalling to the first DROSS operative that one cycle of the relay was complete. Once a set was posted, an invigilator-themed meme was added to direct the audience to the next post elsewhere. The relay continued in this fashion and the performance was concluded in around four hours.
