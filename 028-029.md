"VIRULENCE" is an exploration of human vulnerability when affected by disease. In March of 2020, many regions in the world started their lockdown procedures in order to contain the virulent contagion of COVID19. I was at the epicenter of the first wave in New York City living across from a hospital in my residence in Elmhurst, Queens.  I witnessed first had the effects of the deadly disease and its devastating nature. Exactly a year later, in March of 2021, I was invited to create a video performance thinking about the human condition under the world's pandemic. "VIRULENCE" was created and delivered while I was stuck living in South America for most of 2021. "VIRULENCE" not only threats my own experience and battle with the virus (I got sick twice; once in NYC and the second time in Santa Cruz de la Sierra, Bolivia), but also people's considerations about disease and human resilience for continuing with life.

Through a series of corporal actions, I evoke a state of mind and corporeal affliction evoking the body's reaction to hostile virulent attacks. I begin the performance with a strange looking health mask that contains dry chrysanthemums (the flower of grief and death).  As I begin to remove the mask, the dry petals begin to emerge from it until they are fully visible and start to cover my face.  My hands fight against the strange looking flower, and as the health mask falls, the petals go inside my mouse, nose and cover my eyes.  The struggle is evident and clear; my body is reacting to an intrusive matter, reacting against a virulent attack. I spit the petals of the flower, I shake my head to get them off my eyes, I exhale to get them out of my nostrils, I clean my face with my breath until I can no longer feel their presence on my body. It's my battle, the battle than humanity has had to fight, and is still fighting two years after the virulent attack on the human race.
