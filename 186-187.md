While it's snowing I crossed a bridge onehundred times
1 hour 15 minute performance filmed by a fixed camera. A circa 60 meters Bridge in the middle of nothing, over a river, in the italian alps, far from every town, in a road closed in Winter season.
An action repeated as a mantra or a rosary; a prayer to the nature.
While I repeat the action, my perceptions of the nature around (water, wind, snow, the forest over the bridge, the bridge itself) have changed. I  have become the nature, I have become river, I have becomed the bridge itself.
Is the bridge also a metaphor? Yes, surely!
I thinked about crossing bridges as human practice, but also artistic practice.
