CALIENTE (2021) is a piece where I present an exploration of the erasure of women in the history of literature through the tearing of pages from the great classics.
CALIENTE dives into the meta-narratives to search for the reason of this oblivion towards us women. It confronts pain and pleasure, and how do this apparently opposite conditions dialogue until reaching a common space on women`s body.
The artist lays down on the floor and starts to touch herself beneath a sheet. Then, she hangs the sheets on a wall while projecting a birth. Then, she sits on the floor and begins, next to a tub of water and soap, to erase and tear out the pages of the books, while she makes small slits in her leg that will later serve to soak the pages with her bleeding.
