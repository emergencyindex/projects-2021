This project honors the labor, diligence and history of the many immigrants that have built New York. The artist will roam along 14th Street from Avenue C to the Hudson River, gathering a compilation of insights, documentation, and oral histories from passersby, and from significant spaces within the area. Highlighting the contributions of those that built this city and keep it going, even in the toughest of times, these moments will be compiled into a zine for later physical distribution.
