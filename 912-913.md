“Camino Fantasma” (“Ghost Walk”) was realized using 100 pieces of wood which migrated over the course of two weeks along a picturesque mountain path in the Vall de Gallinera, Spain. In the process the wood morphed from one sculptural form into another four times over. Each installation existed for one day, each taking up three days of the ongoing work process: one day installing, one day of the work being in existence, and the third day of de-installation: a performative act in public sculpture. I like to think of the structures as ghosts, as they have left their material form and have moved on into another form. Ghosts exist as long as the spirit of the expression still captures the imagination, and cease to exist when the imagination does not engage with the spirit anymore. And this will mark the lifespan of this particular work.
