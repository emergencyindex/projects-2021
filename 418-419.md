 I created “A small part contains the whole world” in the framework of the International Performance Encounter organized by Silvio De Gracia during October 2021 when we were starting to come out of confinement due to the COVID pandemic, a time where we had to stay in our homes doing all our activities while the world was in crisis. I was interested in working inside a derelict and abandoned house in a small country town. This piece was born from the encounter with this space, an abandoned house where the ruin converges with the furious outbreak of nature and with the interventions of small human occupations. I decided to work in one of these rooms using a cowhide apron in contact with my own naked torso, carrying a dead skin on my body next to a large dry branch from these fields next to a mantle intervened with natural dyes containing corn flour inside. I began the action by walking along the walls and making them sound with the friction of the branch I was carrying, seeking to recover those hidden echoes, those voices. With the trunk I traced a circle on the floor covered with earth. Then, from inside the blanket I took handfuls of corn flour and threw them in the marked furrow, in an impossible attempt of sowing. Next, I tried to sow the mantle and my body so that the branch would sprout from the center of my abdomen. Finally, I cut the branch with my hands and gave the fragments to those present, whispering a question in their ears, in an attempt to let that which we had been keeping in confinement come out into the public so we could share our experiences, to let the voices and stories come out of the house through the performance. The remains of the performance were left intervening in the house like the ashes of an unreachable action, like everything that happened in this time that we are still trying to understand.
