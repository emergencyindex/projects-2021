AiOP 2021
The Rustbelt Mobile Exchange Center 
Christopher Olszewski
Project Statement:

Christopher Olszewski is a board certified low budget mystic and since 2010 has been producing a variety of socially engaged creative projects. He is also known as The Bishop Rustbelt Messiah. His current creative project "The Rustbelt Mobile Exchange Center" tries to combat the years of negative public relations, cast a positive promotion of the region, rediscover the rich history and document the spirited people of the American Rust Belt.
Christopher aka The Bishop Rustbelt Messiah and his crew will perform in The Rustbelt Mobile Cultural Exchange Center from the trunk of his 1998 Cadillac Deville. It is a NASCAR/Pit stop/guerrilla style performance along
14th street in NYC. Conducing a series of quick stops in open spaces, interacting with the public and displaying the breathtaking and richly designed Alter dedicated to the wonders of the American Rust Belt. More Information: olszewskiart.com

Here’s how it worked:

• Featured vehicle - Christopher’s 1998 Cadillac Deville – supplies packed in spacious trunk
• Find open spot on 14th street – park – crew jumps into action - surround vehicle with orange safety cones
• Next, vehicle covered in bright fabric with project logo
• three to four-minute turnaround
• Four-person pit crew with costumes + film crew - Orange vests
• Trunk open - Rustbelt alter on display with flower arrangement
• Make announcements to public – Good News from The American Rust Belt
• Time is up - Ring bell
• Break down
• Move to next spot
• Repeat
• Start at the Hudson River - travel the entire length of 14th street and back
