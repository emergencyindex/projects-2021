Against the urgent, experimental laptop music of Holly Herndon, Annie-B Parson’s Big Dance Theater explores a story of five sisters in 1980, gathered in their childhood Los Angeles home. A mix of theater, dance, and spoken opera, “The Mood Room” is set during early Reaganism, when Americans were urged to spend and shop rather than actively participate in civic society. In the physical and metaphorical room, the all-female cast dives into a deep self-indulgent bubble, retreating from their responsibilities as participants in the larger world. Referencing multiple texts, including Chekhov’s “Three Sisters” and soap operas, “The Mood Room” is a mirror for being and nothingness, angst and regret, class, and navel-gazing.
