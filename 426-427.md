 “Land in Land” is an art performance in which the multidisciplinary artist Riccardo Matlakas planted a maple tree. The art action addresses the issue of political corruption in Bulgaria. Matlakas proposed the creation of the land “we want” in the existing land, where people would share and express their vision of this future land with no corruption. “Land in Land” is a part of the Visionary Foundation art program 2021, organized with the financial support of the National Cultural Fund and in partnership with the Italian Cultural Institute in Sofia.
