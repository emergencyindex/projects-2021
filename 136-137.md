"POST SUIT" The performance was performed live to a limited audience and video. In the studio space I set up props I created , a made-up bed , two chairs on with and without legs, a green suit draped on legless chair, a lectern with book and microphone , a barred window, a flattened table with a spoon- handkerchief ,cup and shaving gear, a crucifix, religious photograph, industrial light, suit case under bed, shoes, chamber pot spilling contents. I am wearing a suit with confetti , beads and coins in the pockets, a bird cage hangs from the ceiling and a ceiling light points up from the floor. Aodha fellow performer stands at the lectern dress in a black suit, hat, mask and sunglasses. He does not move , stands holding vigil , a shadow or security guard. I sit on the chair the sounds of prison life mixed with street sounds. I stand and reach into my pocket taking out the confetti , beads and coins and drop them onto the floor and my head. I put on the green suit which has the *POST* logo which is the Irish word for mail. I go to the bed and kneel performing religious acts. I stand up and place my head into the bird cage then taking it down and wearing it. I remove the suit case from under the bed and open it , take out a wooden shaped violin and carpenters saw. I play the violin with the saw. I then leave the performance space. This performance was showing online at the   *LATITUDES, International Performance Art Festival of Santa Cruz de la Sierra* in 2022
