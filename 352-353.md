"Assembling" is a meditative, 26-minute dance and features three female-identifying performers. The performers dressed in red uniforms assemble in an urban landscape attempting to find comfort next to hard, uneven rock and concrete surfaces. Their reclining bodies shift slowly and awkwardly over a course of time reflecting on a female subject’s classical representation in the arts as someone who reclines. Their bodies create unexpected sculptural shapes and interconnectedness in space. I am interested in conveying female experience in the world mostly defined by men by juxtaposing soft and hard, slow and fast. In my artistic process I am also interested in conveying environmental anxieties by exploring female relationships to landscape.

"Assembling" is site-specific, and its score is structured and improvisational. The performers practice observing their landscape intimately and from a distance. The practice of observation influences their deeply felt movement connections to the surrounding environment, and is conveyed in their focused presence and demeanor.

In the beginning of the performance the first performer walks into a location that becomes defined as the performative area. She observes her environment which generates a visceral movement response in her. Her visual observations are continuous, and sometimes last longer in one focal point and other times focal points alter quickly. The other performers join the visceral movement meditation one by one. The performers do not touch each other, nor the viewers or people passing by. However, they seem unexpectedly connected with each other as well as with their environment and other people. The urban landscape with its traffic and noise becomes meditatively performative as the performers in red uniforms slowly and awkwardly find interconnection within. With “Assembling" I want to exhibit something simple that suggests focus and direction in the chaos and noise of an urban landscape.
