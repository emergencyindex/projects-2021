“Hidden in plain sight (Chromium Oxide Green)” is a durational performance that took place during the unveiling of a pop-up exhibition called AQUI in the outskirts of Panama City, Panama. AQUI was meant to create a symbiotic relationship between the artwork being displayed and the decaying and abandoned building that housed it. My performance lasted four hours where I painted my head in a green, mossy color and covered my body with an abundance of leaves and plants found within and around the space. With the intention of completely blending in with my environment I remained motionless for the duration of the performance. During that time visitors could see, or not see, my body laying in a room of the house that was completely engulfed by nature. My performance work explores my relationship with space and its state of belongingness. Nature and paint complete my process of transformation mimicking my environment and becoming one with it, thus fulfilling my desire of blending in, or being a part of something larger than me.
