“Touch Me Lick Me” explores the complex material relationships between human bodies and hot glass. In this piece, I record myself pouring honey onto a piece of sheet glass, then pressing my hands, face, body, and mouth onto the sheet. The performance also displays various actions of me licking, consuming, and spitting the honey back onto the glass. In this work, honey is used as a material stand-in for hot glass, due to honey’s extremely similar visual and viscous properties. This material stand-in creates a great amount of tension, with honey being a sensual material that can be touched, tasted, and consumed, compared to hot glass’s capabilities to cause extreme damage to the skin. This work addresses the sensuality and tension of a material that can never be touched, addressing the sticky relationships between bodies and the materials we work with.
