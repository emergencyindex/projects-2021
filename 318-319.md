“Island, Is Land, We Land” was an artist-led communal performance for the tiny island site, an active digging into our embodied connection with the whenua (land) and the poetic construct of being an island together. The performance sought to deepen our relationship with the Earth we inhabit in the critical context of climate emergency; a shared act of bare, ritual stillness. I gathered participants, we removed our clothing to swim naked over to the small island. Two buckets of Papa rock that I collected from Kai Iwi and carried to the site were waiting for us. Taking our time throughout the morning, slowly and purposefully covering each other in the soft Papa rock; we performed gentle movements with our bodies, breath and voice.
