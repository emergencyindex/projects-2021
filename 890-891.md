A participatory reflection on the (im)possibility of utopia making use of sound poetry, masks, and stale bread: A walking thumb piano plays itself and initiates a collective anti-national anthem and sonorous reflection on fragility. The thumb piano turns into a human being who cannot swim yet who promptly offers a highly detailed swimming lesson. An inquest is conducted into why it is not possible to reach the bottom of the sea in one breath and shimmer in ecstasy with the jellyfish. The complex clapping ritual of the hand-sandwich is enacted and the human being turns into a slice of toast. They float away, being feasted upon by hundreds of tiny fish.
