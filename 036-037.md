"ASSIMILATION" is a performance meant to contextualize the drab content of participating in a society bound by a nation with no care for people of my kind. I sit in my studio, my private space, donning a canvas as a mask. I then spray paint the colors red, white and blue: colors of the United States' flag. These shapes take place as a new face onto my blank, beige, canvas head. The face is smiling, but it is not so happy. The face that used to be there has been erased, replaced, colonized and curved to a melancholic smile.
