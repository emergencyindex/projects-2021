Salted Egg Yolk is a livestream performance created specifically to be viewed on Zoom as part of "Routine Maintenance Virtual Performance Festival" organized by the University of North Florida. At the beginning of the performance, I played a video about my trip to Hong Kong during the COVID-19 pandemic using the Zoom Screen Share function while I performed the voice-over of the video live. This part of the zoom session was recorded on my computer. Then I replayed the recorded zoom video again (with my recorded voice-over) while I drew red lines across the sky photos I took in Hong Kong in the background. After I finished playing the zoom recording, I flew paper planes at the photos. Flying paper planes was one of the activities I did when I was in the quarantine hotel. Some of the paper planes were made from the flyers about the 'dos and don'ts' during my quarantine period.

The video addresses the idea of belonging and the changes that happened to my aging parents and in my hometown. It also includes a series of performative actions I did in the quarantine hotel. This piece is an experimentation of various ways to perform for the camera on zoom, which is a livestream platform that has become popular since the pandemic. It also serves as my diasporic yearning for my hometown Hong Kong.
