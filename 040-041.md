With the down up, down up of the needle, a red thread pulls past into future as the present.

The piece was created as part of the 1:1 Tea Service Program. The piece was created specifically for a sole audience member and performed live for that individual over Zoom. The audience also received a specialized tea blend and tea cake for consuming while watching.

More about Tea Service 1:1

1:1 Tea Service is a ritual and a performance experience created for one person. Tea is offered to the audience member both as a healing balm and as a tool for fortune telling. The 1:1 Service, lasting 30-45 minutes, sets forth actions and gestures designed to mend what is torn and ease what might be tender, and nourish. Through meditative audio and invocation, the performer invites the audience member to reflect on an important question in their own lives and, with the performer, divine a response. Each performance is unique and created through a brief advance exchange with the audience member. The result is an intimate, immersive 1:1 Service of sound, food and beverage, performance, and divination.
