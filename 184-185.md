“Camino Fantasma” – Ghost Walk was realized using 100 pieces of wood which migrated over the course of 2 weeks along a picturesque mountain path in the Vall de Gallinera, Spain. In the process the wood morphed from one sculptural form into another 4 times over. Each installations existed for one day, each taking up three days of the ongoing work process: one day installing, one day the work being in existence, and the third day de-installation. A performative act in public sculpture. I like to think of the structures as Ghosts as they have left their material form and have moved on into another form. Ghosts exist as long as the spirit of the expression still captures the imagination, and ceases to exist when the imagination does not engage with the spirit anymore. And this will mark the life span of this particular work.
