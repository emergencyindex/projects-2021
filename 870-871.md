Christopher, aka The Bishop Rustbelt Messiah, and his crew performed “The Rustbelt Mobile Cultural Exchange Center” from the trunk of his 1998 Cadillac Deville. It is a NASCAR/Pit stop/guerrilla style performance along 14th Street in NYC. Conducting a series of quick stops in open spaces, interacting with the public, and displaying the breathtaking and richly-designed altar dedicated to the wonders of the American Rust Belt. Here’s how it worked:- Featured vehicle: Christopher’s 1998 Cadillac Deville. Supplies packed in spacious trunk- Find open spot on 14th Street. Park. Crew jumps into action. Surround vehicle with orange safety cones- Next, vehicle covered in bright fabric with project logo- three- to four-minute turnaround- Four-person pit crew with costumes + film crew. Orange vests- Trunk open. Rustbelt altar on display with flower arrangement- Make announcements to public. Good News from The American Rust Belt- Time is up. Ring bell- Break down- Move to next spot- Repeat- Start at the Hudson River. Travel the entire length of 14th Street and back.
