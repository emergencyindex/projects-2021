On Sunday, August 29 from 1 pm–7 pm, <span class="italic">“REPOSE”</span> traveled the 1.4 mile shoreline between Beach 86th Street and Beach 110th Street. <span class="italic">“REPOSE”</span> borrowed from the social and physical choreographies inherent to the beach—from the sun-bathing bodies lying in repose, to the posturing of the self in forms of commercialized leisure sanctioned by the Parks Department that police and maintain the shoreline. By mirroring these actions, <span class="italic">“REPOSE”</span> both imposed on, and blended into, the beach’s elemental composition, landscape, and communities. As the work traveled with an evolving cohort of 21 dancers, the public was invited, wittingly and unwittingly, to participate. Various instructions and scores for participation were released online and in print prior to and available on the day of the performance. At 6 pm at Beach 110th Street, experimental musician/composer David Watson created a new composition activating the beach through sound including live performance and processed field recordings. The beach-as-stage that <span class="italic">“REPOSE”</span> made use of throughout the day concluded with a sonic sunset.
