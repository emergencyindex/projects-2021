“Post Suit” was performed live to a limited audience and recorded on video. In the studio space I set up props I created, a made-up bed, two chairs (one with and one without legs), a green suit draped on the legless chair, a lectern with book and microphone, a barred window, a flattened table with a spoon, handkerchief, cup, and shaving gear, a crucifix, a religious photograph, industrial light, a suitcase under the bed, shoes, and a chamber pot spilling its contents. I am wearing a suit with confetti, beads, and coins in the pockets. A bird cage hangs from the ceiling and a light points up from the floor. Aodha, a fellow performer, stands at the lectern dressed in a black suit, hat, mask, and sunglasses. He does not move, but stands holding vigil, a shadow or security guard. I sit on the chair while the sounds of prison life mixed with street sounds can be heard. I stand and reach into my pocket taking out the confetti , beads, and coins, and drop them onto the floor and my head. I put on the green suit which has the *POST* logo on it (the Irish word for mail). I go to the bed and kneel, performing religious acts. I stand up and place my head into the bird cage then take it down and wear it. I remove the suitcase from under the bed and open it, take out a wooden violin and carpenters saw. I play the violin with the saw. I then leave the performance space. 

This performance of “Post Suit” dealt with the mental restrictions we imposed on ourselves and the experience of trying to find an outlet to deal with isolation, be it through religion, distracting methods of memory and recalling past events, or by creating activities to combat the situation. The performance space relates to the space of a prison environment by its surreal atmosphere and use of props. Many sounds during the performance came from unrestricted spaces such as the street and the corridors of the institution.
