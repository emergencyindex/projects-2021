Marval A Rex becomes Marilyn Monroe (or does she become him?) in MARILYN MON REX, a timed performative meditation drenched in the violence of "fame"... exploring the psycho-spatial ramifications of Hollywood on urban working populations in Los Angeles. Mon Rex asks this question, "How much longer can we afford to have someone be cooler than somebody else?"
