My 3rd eye is killing me was a dance performance that took place place outside, in-between the blackberry brambles at Treiber Farms. The work was co-created by Leah Fournier and Amelia Heintzelman with input from the collaborators Josie Bettman, Juli Brandano, and Frances Heintzelman. Tommy Martinez created an original sound score. The performance was organized by Olana Flynn. 

The dance was a set of choreographies created during the lockdown, in a 13’ x 19’ whitebox studio, Otion Front in Bushwick, Brooklyn. The choreography was transposed onto the larger group of dancers for the expansive, endless landscape of the farm. The work used orderlessness, weaving, and wildness to expand its reach beyond human form. It was a yearning for expansiveness after so much time confined. 

Dancers wove and ran through the columns of the brambles with kites. The group bounced together in close quarters then expanded outward. The music was poignant and sharp, expressing a homesickness for something other than the present.
