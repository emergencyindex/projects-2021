Mycelium Meditation is a multi-sensorial performance that builds mythological language into our planet's rich evolutionary history. In this immersive meditation, the audience's senses of touch, taste, smell, sight, and hearing became entangled in an eco-morphic approach to telling the story of fungi as one of the greatest shapers of life on this shared earth. The artists called upon our giant prehistoric super-fungi ancestors—the “Dead Gods”—to activate long-dormant parts of our own genome and seek wisdom for enduring extinction epochs. 

This one-hour interactive performance included an eight course food experience by Cosmophage, who performed adorned with live mushrooms, and original music and sound composition by Matt Evans and Jack Helfrich.
