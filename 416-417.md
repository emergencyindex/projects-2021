 In the pandemic era, where people are living in isolation, people are confronted first with the government decree information that disseminates from the digital media, rather than the direct attack of the virus on our bodies. Our minds are in a whirl, while our corporeal bodies are in a state of bareness and helplessness. How can “freedom” be measured in the face of the fear of death, when people are dying constantly? I began by moving my fully-nude body around a room in ruins with a mobile phone strapped to my face and a loudspeaker in my hand. The phone repeatedly played audio amplified through the loudspeaker and generated an echo within the building. I leaned forward and walked along the interior of the building, and upon reaching the last room, I sat down facing the dressing mirror in the corner, picked up scissors to remove the tape from my face, and put down the mobile phone. Next, I took a piece of long red cloth and proceeded to the rooftop. Lastly, I dropped down the long red cloth from the rooftop, which fluttered in the strong wind.
