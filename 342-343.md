Apocalyptic pilgrimage meets dystopian eco-ritual in “Project Hazmatic: Score for Body as Risk Factor.” A solo improviser, clad in a bespoke hazmat suit, dances with a cloud of red tulle at a former military site on the New York City coast. The masked mover incants a fragmented poem cycle, conjuring threats posed by environmental degradation, toxic exposure, and climate change. Score and spectacle merge in homage to our imperiled planet in the age of the Anthropocene.
