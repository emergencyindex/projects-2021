Silence of the Fury 
Although the Pandemic was there for one and a half years, it was not as fearful and terrible as in the second wave, especially in India. The April and May Month of 2021 was hard traumatic and horrible. It got chills to our spines when we saw mass deaths and graves in different cities of India. Cremation grounds were with the piles of Burning bodies in almost all Cities, innumerable people dying with entire families wiped out in large. The Government's official record reports around seven lakhs deaths, nowhere to match the actual as per sources. It unofficially reported twenty-five lakh deaths. Cremation grounds were overflowing, graveyards had no space, floating unclaimed bodies in the river, the river beds were full of dead bodies, and some cities built massive Crematoriums to deal with the number of deaths. The smell of death was all around social media flooded with news of condolence messages and death. Many lost many close friends and family members. The second wave had created fearful smog of death, hopelessness, and loss. The smoke from the burning pyre covered the whole country mourning was everywhere, every family under this grey cloud. The burden of loss was heavy people waited hours outside cremation grounds days and could give a proper send-off to their loved ones with many unregistered mass cremation. This performance was a silent protest about whom to blame. The fear of Human extinction was shadowing - man-made disasters. Whom to blame? one who leaked this virus or to one who was doing and developing this virus?
This video is about the silent anguish, agony, and misery that people experienced and encountered during the period, and the performance is about unregistered deaths and unclaimed bodies. The deep thought towards the lost soul was a silent protest to make every death count. I stood tied up with cut tree branches on my head, holding a doll wrapped in my hand and bodies on flour, metaphorically representing several unclaimed bodies. I was carrying wood on my head, standing still in protest mode, engulfed in smoke and Fire. This work was to bring an unsettled state of mind and loss of the people, the uncertainty of Life itself, the mass graves, and the psychological state of mind of pain, loss, and agony.
