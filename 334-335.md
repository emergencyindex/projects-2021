During the height of third wave pandemic quarantine the performer found himself regularly engaging in sexual rendezvous with mostly closeted "straight" military men near an airbase. Throughout the early spring whilst isolated in a house completely alone, offers were made to random participants via dating apps to engage in performance sexual liberation and cosplay. A select handful of the men wanted to gather for a private party and performance. The performer complied and worked with each individual on the level of privacy for documentation. The end result was a 70 minute performance that was live streamed on a private YouTube channel to approximately 500 viewers.
