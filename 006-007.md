“Still Life with Bunny” is an long-durational performance piece in which I merged art and life with the creation of an entirely new self, a hyperbolic “bunny” identity.

For four months, at the height of 2021 political and social hysteria, I had joined a digital-based cult in order to get a more full, personal understanding of the radicalization of the mind and the subsuming of the will to severe forces. The standards of living were austere: All white clothing, frequent payments, no alcohol/drugs, no smoking, no dirt, no smells, no animals, no costuming, no art….. 

Following my exit from this community, I traveled deep into a way of life that celebrated the aspects of life previously prohibited to me: I wore bunny ears, drank and smoked copiously, dug holes in the dirt, and spent my time with rabbits, raccoons, and pigs. What first began as a simple, celebratory performance soon became more all-encompassing, and I became more reluctant to remove the bunny ears. Eventually I realized that I had created a “bunny” self – a hyperbolic alter ego emerging as a counter balance to the ascetic self I had previously become. 

I obsessed over this realization, fixating on the malleability of identity, the creation of a cult-of-one, and self-radicalization through one’s own visions as a means of transcending the limits of the identity and environment. Living through an alter ego, I was able to channel and perform the hysteria, confusion, and hegemony of the world without absorbing it.

Living as the “bunny” archetype became an extended performance where art and life merged entirely. I documented this period through numerous “Still Life” performances, mise-en-scènes of my behaviors at that time: sleeping with pigs, grazing in gardens, reading books to raccoons… 

To this day, the “bunny” self stays with me, used as an important resource in my creative practice.
