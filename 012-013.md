A series of corporal movements based on contemporary dance technique on the grounds of a construction site as a stage.

During my action, I trace steps on the dirt that flooded the area, forming geometric figures such as circles with repetitions that can be interpreted as a visual poem and the wind as a perfect rhythm.

To walk, to move forward, go back a little; turn and see the way; keep following the instructions of a manual or life. Between density, decadence, and the apocalypse, the black bird emerges from within the ashes, like a phoenix.
