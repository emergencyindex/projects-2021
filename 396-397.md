“Women, Earth, Epic” is a cross-continent collaboration performance for the camera focusing on the role of women in relation to environmental issues. Each and all the collaborators were residing in different places from Isfahan, Iran to California, the US. We have considered narrative rituals in this ongoing project coinciding with the roles of each goddess as appeared in the Epic of Gilgamesh. One of the significant issues that we continuously dealt with was following the dress code requirements of Iran, which concluded a lot of technical concealing and self-employed censorship.
