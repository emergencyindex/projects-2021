"You Have The Tools"

We are more than vessels,  give us the tools we need to succeed. 

Two boxes are taped to the floor, one box has an opening with a full bowl of water, an unopened bag of flour, two baking pans, and three packets of yeast. The other box has no openings and contains no tools to bake bread. Scattered around the closed box is a half-opened bag of flour with most of its contents scattered on the floor. A cloudy bowl of water is just out of reach, and packets of opened yeast have been tossed nearby. There are no baking sheets.

I occupy the closed box with no resources. I reach just beyond the box, but I am unable to physically leave the confines of the square on the floor. I scoop and collect the left-over material, desperately trying to accumulate enough resources to start producing bread. 

I shape the flour I have collected into a pile then place my clenched hands in the center to create a moat where I pour the mixture of dirty water and yeast collected from the floor.  Hair, dirt, dust, and debris are visible in the mixture as itâ€™s poured into the moat.  Liquid seeps over the walls of the moat and onto the floor, I start to knead the mass into a ball. My hands are covered in a thick, sticky dough that restricts every movement. I keep adding liquid, and a dough starts to form, I angrily slam the soft mass onto the floor repeatedly.

The dough is ready, but there is no pan to bake it.  I scan the room and find two, unused baking pans within the box that holds a complete arsenal of supplies. I clean my hands using the delicate black lace of my skirt. Slowly I leave my box without passing over the marks on the floor.  My fingers barely touch the cold metal of the stacked baking pans, they move away quickly.  Lurching forward with force, I connect with the pans.  I have one pan firmly within my grasp but I recoil into my own box, slamming the pan on the ground with a loud clang.  

I gently shape the dough and places it in the pan, wipe my hands once again on my skirt and then cradle the pan of dough in my arms.
