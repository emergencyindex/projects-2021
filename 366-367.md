Positing a future where colonial structures are dead and no longer hold power, dance and somatic tools carve a space to grieve and release them. Through experimental movement scores, "Grief Dances" explores the futurist potential of grief, while the scores also function by inverse, acknowledging that both grieving and decolonization are never-ending processes. Locating, listening to, and moving with pain/pleasure/land, the event score is performed simultaneously by two performers, across ocean and time. The lands on which the scores take place are Toronto/Tkaronto, “where there are trees standing in the water” in the Mohawk language, and Glasgow/Glaschu, or “green hollow” in Gaelic.
