I’ve always fantasized about playing this classic song at someone’s wedding, in-particular my sister’s—so when the hypothetical opportunity came to do it for two of my friends who were getting hitched to one another, I figured it might be my only chance, so I made-up-my-mind to pursue it. 

I semi-jokingly told them that it’d be my pain-staking pleasure to gift that to them, instead a thoughtless one & done monetary one, all-along thinking that they’d never subject their guests to such a thing—but when the ceremony was canceled due to Covid-related reasons, with the only public gathering being a more informal shower before their private, family-only espousal, I knew that my decrepit appearance / shitty amateur performance of something so intricate & beautiful in-essence, could actually come to fruition—so I drew up a whole plan to have one of my other friends at the event, during the gift-giving, say in a voice, loud enough that someone might overhear, “Hey, C.J., didn’t you bring your guitar?” To which I’d then act modest & nonchalant, go out to my car and grab the axe, and proceed to perform for them something that I’d been practicing for weeks—but every time he said it, he got cut-off & drowned-out, by someone or something, so it never happened. 😞

Returning home, I was determined to give them my gift, so I had my semi-crippled roommate, Mark, film the final performance (and multiple fuck-up rehearsals) on his phone, in our driveway, in front of the trash cans, while he smoked in his van, which I then proceeded to send to the bride & groom-to-be, along with a number of other select recipients. 

Like a child’s parent-presented finger-painting, it wasn’t exactly a Picasso, as it included multiple shrill errors—but I’d like to think that it’s the thought that counts, and is what makes it “real.” 

As my mom would say, “A for effort.” 

Hopefully they put it on their metaphorical fridge.
